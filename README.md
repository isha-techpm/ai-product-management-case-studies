# 📊 Product Management Portfolio – Isha Jha

Welcome to my Product Management portfolio.

I am transitioning into a **Product Manager / Associate Product Manager** role. This portfolio is created to demonstrate how I approach product problems, document requirements, think about users and metrics, and collaborate across teams — even though my formal PM experience is still growing.

My background spans data, engineering, QA, and freelance projects. I am continuously upskilling through courses and hands-on practice, and this repository represents my learning-by-doing approach to Product Management.

## 📁 Repository Overview

This portfolio is organized into four main sections:

* **Case Studies** – End‑to‑end product thinking exercises, mainly focused on AI-driven systems
* **Certificates** – Verified certifications supporting my PM, analytics, and business foundations
* **PRDs** – Product Requirement Documents based on real projects, freelance work, and structured assessments
* **Resume** – My current resume highlighting my transition into Product Management

Each folder has its own README explaining the context and intent behind the work.
